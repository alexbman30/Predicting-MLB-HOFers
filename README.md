Baseball Databank is a compilation of historical baseball data in a
convenient, tidy format, distributed under Open Data terms.


Organisation of the files
-------------------------

There are two directories in the repository.

* 'data' contains the databank itself.  If you are a user of the data, these are the
  files you need.

Most of the data in the Databank is provided by Chadwick Baseball Bureau
(http://www.chadwick-bureau.com).  The data differ from the data the Bureau provides
to its clients in that it contains less detail, is updated less frequently, 
and is provided on an as-is basis.


* 'Predicting_Pitchers.ipynb', 'Predicting_Catchers.ipynb', and 'Predicting_players.ipynb' contains the notebook detailing the process followed
to predict hall of fame likelihood

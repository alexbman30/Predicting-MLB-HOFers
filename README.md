Organisation of the files
-------------------------

There are two directories in the repository.

* 'data' contains the databank itself.  If you are a user of the data, these are the
  files you need.
* 'upstream' contains files used to construct the databank.

Most of the data in the Databank is provided by Chadwick Baseball Bureau
(http://www.chadwick-bureau.com).  The data differ from the data the Bureau provides
to its clients in that it contains less detail, is updated less frequently, 
and is provided on an as-is basis.


*'Predicting_Pitchers', 'Predicting_Catchers', and 'Predicting_players' contains the notebook detailing the process followed
to predict hall of fame likelihood
